To get started with PostgreSQL exercises, you can follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL Exercises Getting Started page. You'll need to set up a PostgreSQL database and make sure your connection string is correctly configured in your tests.

To run the tests in your repository, use the following command:
```
npx playwright test tests/postgres.spec.ts
```
